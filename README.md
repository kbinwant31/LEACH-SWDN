# LEACH-SWDN
Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Sliding Window and Dynamic Number of Nodes (LEACH-SWDN) is based on LEACH. 
Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) is a TDMA-based MAC protocol that is integrated with clustering and a simple routing protocol in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The goal of LEACH is to lower the energy consumption required to create and maintain clusters in order to improve the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. <br>
**LEACH-SWDN** is an improved LEACH algorithm using sliding window and the number of living nodes. The sliding window is used to make the interval that generates random number and it can change with the residual energy; the number of living nodes is used to dynamically adjust the number of optimal cluster head in the whole network.
